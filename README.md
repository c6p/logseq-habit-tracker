Record your habits under `#habit` block in daily journal, then easily track your habits.

Habit format is `Habit text - 1,2,3` and you can add notes after a new line.  
Default pattern to match it is `^(?<habit>.*?)(?:| - (?<count>.*?))$` where:
* **habit** is the identifier for the habit and
* **count** is comma separated list of things (e.g. numbers, time).

For `Frequency / Period`, period is one of `d` (day), `w` (week), `m` (month), `y` (year).
- `3/d` means 3 times per day
- `4/2w` means 4 times in 2 weeks

### Customization

Instead of nesting under `#habit` tag you can also use it in every line and change the format to suit your needs.

#### Example 1

```
14:10 pushups #habit
14:11 #habit drink water
```
Habit Pattern: `\d{2}:\d{2} (?<habit>.*)`

##### Example 1a
With optional time and notes. Thanks @someinternetguy
```
pushups #habit
pushups #habit did 10 more than usual today, go me!
14:17 pushups #habit
14:17 pushups #habit yay, I remembered to work out today!
```
Habit pattern: `((\d{2}:\d{2})|())(?<habit>.*#habit(\s|\b))`
